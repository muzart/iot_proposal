As explained above, there are already several domain-specific MDE notations and tools that can be reused for designing, modeling and developing smart city architectures and applications by distinguishing different design aspects and perspectives such as views, viewpoints, components, communication protocols, etc. For the sake of interactivity by co- llaborative development, maintenance and consistency, evolution and flexibility, they mostly lack collaborative designing and development support by sharing the artifacts of smart city architectures, models and applications among collaborators. The most existing tools use standard UML profiles by defining their own notations. However, these tools are developed on the top of EMF â€“ eclipse modeling framework, Sirius and Obeo Designer using Ecore-based meta-modeling feature and stan- dard UML meta-models. The collaborative modeling infrastructure introduced in Section 3 will be applied to these existing tools using their underlying meta-models.
