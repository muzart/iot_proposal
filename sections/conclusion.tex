This proposal focuses on model-driven IoT. Initially, this proposal has briefly studied the state of the art in MDE approaches for IoT systems, applications and architectures. These discussions have shown that the research in the field of model-driven IoT is still in its early stages. So, extended research in the field of model-driven IoT is needed. 

As noted, MDE offers great opportunities for development and support for IoT-based smart systems. MDE will accelerate the process of developing smart systems and applications for them, qualitatively complete and further expand at the next evolution stages.
