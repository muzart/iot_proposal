This paper has, first of all, shortly reviewed the state of the art in MDE approaches for IoT applications. The IoT paradigm is also subject to constant changes such as extensions, improvements and optimizations during their initial development and evolutionary life-cycle. These ever growing applications are developed and maintained by the teams of developers and designers. In order to provide team work on such huge and evolving model-driven applications, there is a need for collaborative modeling support.

As noted, MDE offers great opportunities for development and support for Smart X applications based on IoT. The collaborative modeling approach will accelerate the process of developing Smart X applications, allowing it to qualitatively complete and further expand at the next evolution stages.

This paper has demonstrated promising vision and prospects to applying collaborative modeling infrastructure \cite{Kuryazov2018collab} to engineering and developing the IoT applications that are core concepts in developing smart cities. As long as there are already sufficient model-driven engineering and development tools for IoT, development of such tools is out of the scope in this paper.

As a future work as explained in Section~\ref{sec:proposedApproach}, the collaborative modeling approach will be applied to existing domain-specific modeling tools for IoT. Eventually, interactivity of developers, consistency of software projects and collaborative development will be achieved.
